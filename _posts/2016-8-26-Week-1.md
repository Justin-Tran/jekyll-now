title: Week 1

In the past week I have gone through the syllabus and installed Docker. At the moment, because the class has just begun, I have not faced any challenges and so there does not seem to be anything in my way. Next week I intend to familiarize myself with the tools talked about in class and hopefully begin working on project one.

This is the first post on my experience in Professor Downing's Software Engineering class. There isn't much to talk about considering it's the first week but we've talked about a myriad of different software we will be using such as Docker, unittest, and the like. It seems a little bit overwhelming but it always does at first. I'm sure we will ease into using these software and they will be vitally important towards developing a working and robust website. Upon professor Downing's suggestion, I have dropped OOP in fear of the overlapping due dates. 

I have met some new people in the class as well as old friends and look forward to working with these people. I believe I know who I want to work with as a team yet this will not deter me from attempting to meet new people and making new friends. 

In conclusion, web development is a field I have definitely been interested in for awhile and one I had some experience with this summer at my Spiceworks internship. While I was there I had quite a bit of trouble with dockerizing my application and hope this class will help me become more familiar with Docker.
