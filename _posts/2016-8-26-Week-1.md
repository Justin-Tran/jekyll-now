This is the first post on my experience in Professor Downing's Software Engineering class. There isn't much to talk about considering it's the first week but we've talked about a myriad of different software we will be using such as Docker, unittest, and the like. It seems a little bit overwhelming but it always does at first. I'm sure we will ease into using these software and they will be vitally important towards developing a working and robust website. Upon professor Downing's suggestion, I have dropped OOP in fear of the overlapping due dates. 

I have met some new people in the class as well as old friends and look forward to working with these people. Web development is a field I have definitely been interested in for awhile and I look forward to learning all about it.
